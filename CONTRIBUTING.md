## Core

- Samarth Patel

## Makes uses of code by

- Several Python libraries. See `dependency-licenses.md` for the dependencies this project directly uses as well as the licenses they are distributed under

- [Peter Evans](https://github.com/peter-evans) for Github Action to automatically apply Python Black formatting to the repository. The github action can be found on [his blog](https://peterevans.dev/posts/github-actions-how-to-automate-code-formatting-in-pull-requests/)

# Contributing Guidelines

As this is still a new project with few contributors, these guidelines are still flexible. As the project becomes more stable, expect these to change as well.

## Creating Issues and Pull Requests

As we are still small, issues and pull requests do not have to be fully fleshed out. If we have discussed it already, a descriptive title could be sufficient. This is mainly so that we can focus on quickly developing the project instead of formalizing something that we have already established.

As we grow, this approach is certainly not scalable. All ideas cannot be run by project leads, so properly formatted issues and pull requests will go a long way. For convenience, there are issue templates set up to help automate this process.

## Writing Documentation

With multiple contributors, it is important for everyone to be on the same page. Follow these simple rules to make sure that the repository stays understandable for everyone

- The best documentation is not needing any. Use good variable names and write self documenting code. Avoid complex syntax and solutions that sacrifice readability for little to no performance gain
- For non-trivial functions, write a comment that explains what the function does. What parameters does it take, how does it modify the application state, and what does it return?
- If the internals of a function are complicated, write a few block comments explaining what that section of code does. Fewer, big picture comments are better than lots of small comments that paraphrase the line they represent
